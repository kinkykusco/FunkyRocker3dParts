Included are two different handles.  "Handle" is the original, taken from the funky rocker plans.  It comes in two parts, precut with a dovetail for gluing so it fits on most build plates.  I suggest variable layer height so you can get a smoother surface of the handle itself.

The second option, "Handle Modified", gets rid of the handle portion of the part.  In practice, we found she doesn't need the handle at all, she just moves the rocker forward and back with her legs.  Her hands are more likely to be busy elsewhere.  Rather, when we use the chair together, the handle was just causing problems, as it limited how closely I could sit in front of her.  By eliminating the protrusion, we find the rocker more fun to use as a couple.  It also makes it slightly smaller, so easier to hide away in a closet or box. Finally, it's small enough to fit on a 256mm x 256mm build plate in one go. I highly recommend using Handle Modified over handle.
