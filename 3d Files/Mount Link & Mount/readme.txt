Mount and MountLink are the original FunkyRocker design of those parts.


MountAndMountLinkScrew is a replacement for those two, with a m18 female screw adaptor for attaching the following to:

FlatMountScrew is a flat plate for suction cup dildos, along with edge clips for tying a dildo on.
VLAdaptor and VLAdaptorTall are two Vac-U-lock adaptors meant for the Screw
MaleScrewModel is just the screw portion of an adaptor, to make it easy to create your own whatever to go on top of the mount.  You can join this part directly to anything else in your slicer to easily create different adaptors.  Do remember that 3d prints are generally not recommended for use inside the human body though.

Print any part with the screw section (male or female) aligned on the z axis (upwards).  Also print the screw section with small layer height. Doing both will keep the screw geometry as accurate as possible.  The screw parts already have been modified to account for the inaccuracy of FDM printing by loosening their tolerance so no further modification should be required.

If you are expecting your rocker to get used vigorously or for a lot of force to be put onto the insertable, increase the wall count and infill to strengthen the adaptor as necessary.
