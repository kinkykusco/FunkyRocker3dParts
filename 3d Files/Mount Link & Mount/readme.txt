Mount and MountLink are the original FunkyRocker design of those parts, requiring the VL toy adaptor to be purchased.  I included these just in case you already own the vac-u-lock adaptor.

MountAndMountLinkScrew is a replacement for those two which skips needing the vac-u-lock adaptor to be purchased, because it has an m18 female screw adaptor for attaching the following to:

FlatMountScrew is a flat plate for suction cup dildos, along with edge clips for tying a dildo on.  Use this if you're wanting to use the rocker with a non vac-u-lock dildo.
VLAdaptor and VLAdaptorTall are two Vac-U-lock adaptors meant for the Screw.  I have found that VLAdaptor works great for our vac-u-lock dildo.  

MaleScrewModel is just the screw portion of an adaptor, to make it easy to create your own whatever to go on top of the mount.  You can join this part directly to anything else in your slicer to easily create different adaptors. 

Handle is a handle with the m18 female threaded part, so you can take your dildo off the funky rocker and use it handheld easily.

Print any part with the screw section (male or female) aligned on the z axis (upwards).  Also print the screw section with small layer height. Doing both will keep the screw geometry as accurate as possible.  The screw parts already have been modified to account for the inaccuracy of FDM printing by loosening their tolerance so no further modification should be required. 

The VLAdaptor/VLAdaptorTall should be printed with at least 8 walls or more, you want them to be very strong and generally walls increase strength more then increased infill.  

If you are expecting your rocker to get used vigorously or for a lot of force to be put onto the insertable, increase the wall count and infill to strengthen the adaptor as necessary.  You can also slightly angle the adaptor something like 10-20 degrees off it's axis, to inscrease the strength at critical join areas like where the screw ends and the flared base of the adaptor begins.  This reduces the chances of it snapping here, without compromizing the geometry of the threads, at the cost of increased supports.
